# WordPress Website

This is custom styling I've created that I add manually to my WordPress website.

It's not exactly the best system but I refuse to get sucked in to the WordPress PHP/Hack development ecosystem (respectfully).

I am in the process of migrating my website to Webflow so some of this may still end up being relevant.

## Getting Started

```shell
sass style.scss style.css --no-source-map --style compressed --watch
```

## Updating WordPress

Run this command and then paste into "Additional CSS".
